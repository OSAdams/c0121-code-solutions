User can sign up
  The App Component is rendered. The user is asked to sign-in or register.
  If the user is registered, they can sign-in and will be redirected. If the
  user needs to register an account, the <AuthForm> is rendered. The handleChange
  method is called and it sets the state of the username. If both the username
  and and password are entered the handleSubmit method is called and sends a
  request to sign-up and the password is hashed. Then the username and password are
  sent to the database. If both fields aren't filled, an error is returned.

User can sign in
  When the user puts in their username and password and hit enter, a post request
  is sent to the middleware. If there isn't a username and password when the user
  hits enter, an error will be returned. The password is compared to the hashed
  password and if they do not match, an error will be returned. When the sign in
  is successful, the home page is rendered.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page)
  The token they recieved is saved to local storage. Whenever the page is reloaded,
  the token is verified so they state is set to the user.

User can sign out
  When the user clicks sign out, the handleSignout method is called and the token
  is removed from local storage. The state is set to its initial value. The user
  is taken back to the sign-in or register page.
